# Cowabunga Themes

This is a little project for cowabunga users, right now it contains 10 themes but I'll add more when I have free time. When I figure out more stuff I'll add custom operators and other stuff, I might add stuff for FileSwitcherPro too.

The main inspiration for this project is [Fomri's Cowabunga Pack](https://github.com/Fomri/Cowabunga-Pack-by-Fomri), you should go check it out.
